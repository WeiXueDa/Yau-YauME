# Yau-YauME
A comprehensive web application built with Streamlit that compares two advanced stochastic filtering methods: Hermite Spectral Method and Finite Difference Method (QIEM). This interactive platform allows users to simulate, visualize, and compare the performance of different filtering algorithms for nonlinear stochastic systems.
